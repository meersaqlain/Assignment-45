//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
//print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let arr1 = ["Ali","Talha","Arhum","Abubakr"];
for (let i=0; i<arr1.length; i++){
    console.log("Hi",arr1[i],"How Are You Shall I Order Something For You");
 
}
