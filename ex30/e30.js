//Hello Admin: Make a array of five or more usernames, including the name 'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. Loop through the array, and print a greeting to each user:
let usernames = ["admin", "user1", "user2", "user3", "user4"];
usernames.forEach(username => {
    if (username === "admin") {
        console.log("Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?");
    }
    else {
        console.log(`Hello ${username}, thank you for logging in again.`);
    }
});
